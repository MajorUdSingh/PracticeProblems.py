# Well of ideas
Q.For every good kata idea there seem to be quite a few bad ones!
In this kata you need to check the provided array (x) for good ideas 'good' and bad ideas 'bad'. If there are one or two good ideas, return 'Publish!', if there are more than 2 return 'I smell a series!'. If there are no good ideas, as is often the case, return 'Fail!'.

Ans's (1) Using single line return statements.
def well(x):
    c = x.count('good')
    return 'I smell a series!' if c > 2 else 'Publish!' if c else 'Fail!'
(2) Using lambda
well = lambda x: ('Fail!','Publish!','I smell a series!')[('good' in x) + (x.count('good')>2)]


# Remove First and Last Character
It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
